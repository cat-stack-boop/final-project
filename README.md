The Navbar has three links HOME, FORM and ABOUT us
HOME - can be used to Navigate back from the ABOUT us page

ABOUT US -  has the fun fact about the developers of this application
Users need to populate all the fields and submit the form. 
Error messages will show the reason for submit button not firing.
